vc 84:
	- fixed the missing const& refs in colony constructor

vc 85:
	- door functionality is now outsourced into door class
	- door class cannot hold a tile reference since the tiles are stored in a
	  dynamic vector, thus the update and reset methods receive their
	  corresponding Tile& based on the coordinates save in the Door objects

vc 86:
	- edited the todo list
	- added documentation for Door header

vc 87:
	- tested implementation where doors take 2 steps but can be passed by
	  programming a single step into program routine
	- this however might lead to behaviour not intended by the user so the
	  necessary code has been commented out (curren_move.m_steps++; in 
	  calculate_collision method)

vc 88:
	- added enumeration best_direction to store the direction of the next best
	  tile on the path to patchbot

	- minor changes to code formatting

vc 95:
	- merged task 6 into master branch

vc 96:
	- robots are now stored in shared_ptr inside the robots vector in colony
	  instead of just raw object to enable the use of polymorphism

vc 97:
	- added a Bugger, a LineRobot and PathfinderRobot subclass from Robot
	- each subclass overrides an void update() method
	- AI should be implemented as controller which receives robot instances
	  as parameters and calculates their move

vc 98:
	- added AI for the Bugger robot
	- added AIController
	- lots of code cleanup necessary

vc 99:
	- the bugger can now crash leaving a gravestone for 5 timesteps
	- Robots are now properly reset

vc 100:
	- added documentation to ai_controller.cpp

	- Robots backup position is now stored in a Point2D

vc 102:
	- Robots position is now stored in a Point2D instead of seperate coords

vc 103:
	- editable tiles can now be retrieved via 2 coordinates or a Point2D
	- changes usage of get editable tile to Point2D where it made sense

vc 104:
	- added collision to patchbot
	- remove the static method for calculating occupation change and instead
	  created a member method with takes a robot and its target position
	  in order to move the robt and change the occupation of the tiles involved
	- further code clean up in ai_controller.cpp

vc 105:
	- Tiles now store the id of the robot which is on the tile instead of a
	  flag which just indicated if there is a robot on the field
	- added the functionality for patchbot to push other robot's if the
	  environment allows it

vc 106:
	- resetting the colony is now done in the colony class itself instead
	  of in the gamecontroller
	- moved other resetting functionalities accordingly

vc 107:
	- complete rework of the door systems
	- doors now check for any robot on them
	- fixed a bug where patchbots starting tile would not be reset correctly

vc 108:
	- fixed a bug where bugger would not correctly override check_collision
	  from robot.h

vc 109:
	- move until obstacle now correctly responds to other robots in patchbot's
	  way

vc 110:
	- all robot classes now forward declare colony
	- virtual void update now takes a Colony& ref as argument in order to
	  switch to an ai implementation in the robot classes

vc 111:
	- LineRobot x component is done --> mirror it for y direction
	- check collision method now returns true if there is collision in all 
	  implemented robot subclasses

vc 112:

	- added vector storing all location of destroyables walls to colony

vc 115:
	- added y movement to LineRobots
	- added Patchbot class (implementation wip)

vc 116:
	- fixed patchbots check_collision
	- TODO: check GameState in controller and use patchbots new collision in
	  controller

vc 117:
	- the game is now lost when patchbot is pushed into water or abyss

vc 118:
	- moved bugger AI into bugger class
	- removed AIController

vc 119:
	- linerobots now correctly react to doors

vc 120:
	- renamed BuggerStates to BuggerState
	- pathfinder robot AI WIP
	- basic semantics of pathfinder ai are now implemented

vc 121:
	- added implementations for check_collision and check_reachable to 
	  pathfinder AI

vc 122:
	- pathfinder AI now moves
	- fixed a bug where a wall drestroyed by digger would not be seen as 
	  UNSET by the dijkstra pathing algorithm

vc 123:
	- added bresenham implementation for checking line of sight for pathfinder
	  robots

vc 124:
	- pathfinder robots now destroy patchbot upon reaching his location
	  when a pathfinder robot reaches patchbot the game is lost

vc 125:
	- dijkstra pathfinding no longer expands tiles with robots on them instead
	  they are added as leaf-nodes so pathing is possible from the tile itself
	  but they still represent a obstacle to further pathfinding

TODO:
	- clean up colony class
	- dijkstra should only update reachable tiles and not reset all already
	  calculated pathing
