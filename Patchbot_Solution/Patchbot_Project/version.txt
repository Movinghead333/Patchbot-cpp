	  by the qt-library
	- task 4 finished (maybe some cleanup left)

vc 50:
	- GameController now stores QImages instead of Texture objects

vc 64:
	- added the ability to program patchbot
	- the programming interface buttons are now all functional

vc 65:
	- scrollbar for programming window almost working
	- transfer commit

vc 66:
	- programming field is now fully implemented
	- scrolling the program textfield works too

vc 67:
	- mission buttons now disable each other according to task

vc 68:

	- all buttons now enable / disable the ui correctly
	- added a check for if the program is empty so it cannot be started
	- improved controller class documentation
	- added flag to represent wether automatic mode is active or not

TODO:
	- robtots and patchbot getter might receive a const depending on game
	  implementation

TASK 5:

DONE: startbutton: disable program-button-interface, sets itself to unwritable
	- stepbutton: do one step patchbot moves first, then all opposing robots
	  and lastly the whole environment receives an update
	- automaticbutton: automatic modus executes one step each second and sets
	  the stepbutton as well as the autmaticbutton itself to unwritable
	- stopbutton: stops the currently executed automatic-mode and sets the step
	  and automaticbutton back to writeable; disabled by default
	- cancelbutton / resetbutton: 
		- stops the current program-execution
		- removes patchbot from map
		- resets the environment (in this task only doors get reset)

	- program single step function and interaction with the environment
	  (patchbot opening door, falling into abyss, etc.)
	- implement win and loose conditions (reaching rootserver, the program
	  running out before patchbot reaches his goal, etc.)
	- update environment (doors in this task, mentioned abobe)
	- create classes for doors as well as for patchbot to minimize runtime
